# Foxter

A twitter clone

## Overview

Foxter is a simple twitter-like app. You can post messages and view all posts made by users. The app is built using React.

The App is in development. Currently the app provides an input field where users can type in their messages, and a "Post a Fox" button to submit the message. The messages are displayed in a list on the same page, with the newest messages appearing at the top. Each message can be deleted by clicking on a "Delete" button next to it. New features get added every week. 


## Features
